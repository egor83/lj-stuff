- fix PyCharm warnings;
- refactor stuff: make comparer a separate module, like in HN stuff;

- multi UI:
  - create a separate version;
  - NB review and update title/etc in a new UI (now using text from the paired version);
  - later make paired version a particular case of a multi UI;
- logs: add a line for performing the comparsion, to separate from all the other log records;
- recommend friends: show persons most people in your friend list read;

1/2 DONE - compare 3+ users' friend lists;
- limit the amount of users for comparison;
- start with the shortest?;
- implement a delay when fetching the data from LJ to prevent banning (look up the guidelines);
- multi: (how?) show common friends/fofs for subgroups of a given group; (eg if 4 ppl don't have anyone in common fs/fofs, show for all possible subgroups of 3)

- random: given a user, randomly select three of his friends, find common for them;

- wrong username - catch&handle for both cases (pair&multi);
- current fetching function would just fail silently after three DownloadErrors - fix; use gae-fetch from gae-tools
- handle reloading results page w/o the posted data (now displays empty page)
- NB "free_attorney" twice - strip() username; NB f-f and f_f

- find your 'closest'/'farthest' friends by sorting your list of friends by the amount of common friends/friend-ofs;

- counter - memcache + increment;
- should I close opener once URL is fetched? (open + with)
- documenting functions, re-read style guide (PEP 8 - start with "Whitespace in Expressions and Statements")
- a lot of long strings, any better way to handle it?
- change language from GET argument to one of POST? (from IRC - session data (cookies?))
- (?) replace existing algorithm with a call to multi with only 2 usernames;


???
- why does Django escape stuff for multi, but not for pair? code is copy-pasted;


Later:
- translate w/ cookies;
- LJ feed doesn't contain memorial journals and following sites; friends' numbers displayed on page (drugoi: 62080)
    are different from Yandex (61158), real output on page (4789) and in a feed (2379) are again different;
- MIME type for favicon? ("Could not guess mimetype for static/images/favicon.ico" when deploying)
- google data model - list of strings? See comments in the code;
- (unit)tests;
- meta keywords?
- Stripped prohibited headers from URLFetch request: ['Host']
- handle Cyrillic input in username fields
- add a note that LJ might not always give the full information or that the user can choose to hide who reads him;

HISTORY:
v. 1-1 - comparing multiple users added; lacks limits on number of users, pauses when fetching users' data from LJ etc


DONE:
- favicon
- html - button, passing data via post or get+arguments - try out
- add logging: when and who accessed the site; when and what queries were made to LJ;
- add titles;
- read about exceptions
- test exceptions
- error handling - wrap it in try...except and log the exceptions; (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5262146/when-to-use-try-except-blocks-in-gae)
- error handling - eg getting banned;
- fails on URL fetching sometimes, Google points to request to itself/more than one request at a time,
    but I'm sure I don't have two simultaneously

    http://osdir.com/ml/GoogleAppEngine/2009-02/msg00240.html
- translate;
- empty friend lists - ok
- LJ profile page doesn't show the full list of friends (what about feed? - check drugoi, tema) - dupe
- GAE fetches favicon 4 times; why and should I worry about it? (NB - 1 time for GET, page build from HTML, 4 times for post, page is written directly into output, but nore than 4 times; change result into html too and compare - DONE: once or twice now)
IRR - make a note if a user has hidden his list of friends - how do I know?
- get rid of this warning:
